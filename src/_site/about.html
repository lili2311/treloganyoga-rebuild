	<h1>About Trelogan Yoga </h1>
	<p>Developed in India thousands of years ago, yoga has become an increasingly popular form of exercise. The purpose of yoga is to create strength, awareness and harmony in both the mind and body.</p>

	<p>I am a British Wheel of Yoga qualified yoga teacher and have been teaching for more than 6 years in Chester and North Wales. I attend regularly intensive training courses and workshops. The class workout I teach incorporates breathing exercises, stretching and yoga postures in Vinyasa (flowing) style or Yoga for Fitness and Flexibility. The students learn how to understand their body and begin to move more effectively and efficiently, improving posture, strength, flexibility and self-awareness. The class is suitable for a total beginner or an accomplished athlete. At the end of the class I offer a guided relaxation session. Classes can vary in duration from 45 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes. A longer class will give a student more time to learn the breathing and relaxation and will give me time to work with student's individual ability.</p>
	
	<p>Fitness level does not matter because there are modifications for every yoga pose. We work barefoot on non-slip yoga mats, which can be purchased at any fitness shops or online. I can provide students with yoga mats but prefer when they bring their own simply for hygiene purposes and also having yoga mat at home may encourage them to do some practice at home. Students can wear any comfortable clothing, which does not restrict their movements. If a student has health problems it is advisable to check with a doctor.</p>
